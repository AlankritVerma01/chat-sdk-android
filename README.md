# Next Steps

## Check out the Development Guide

We've written a [comprehensive Development Guide](https://github.com/chat-sdk/docs) which is available in the docs repository. 

If you thing that something is missing, you can post a new issue and we will update the guide. 

We have a number of additional guides available on our [Wiki](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-android/wiki).

Also checkout the other guides:

1. [Build a custom push notification handler](https://github.com/chat-sdk/docs/blob/master/Custom%20Push%20Handler.md)
2. [Android UI customization](https://github.com/chat-sdk/docs/blob/master/Android%20Customize%20UI.md)

## Configuration

The Chat SDK can be customized during setup using the configuration builder object. For a full list of options, take a look at [here](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-android/blob/master/chat-sdk-core/src/main/java/co/chatsdk/core/session/Configuration.java). 

#### Configuration using the Configuration Builder

In your main `onCreate` method you create a new instance of the `Configuration.Builder` and pass it to the `ChatSDK` singleton on initialization.

Here you have the option to set far more properties. For example:

##### Set a custom user name and avatar

```
builder.defaultUserName("TestUser");
builder.defaultUserAvatarUrl("http://your-site/image.png");
```

Remember that in the instructions we will advise you to configure using the Android Manifest but you are always free to use the direct configuration method instead.

## Module Setup

There are a number of free and premium extensions that can be added to the Chat SDK. 

### Firebase Modules

For the following modules:

- [Typing indicator](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/typing-indicator/)
- [Read receipts](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/read-receipts/)
- [Location based chat](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/location-based-chat/)
- [Audio messages](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/audio-messages/)
- [Video messages](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/video-messages/)
- [Contact book integration](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/contact-book-integration/)

The free modules are located in the main [Github repository](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-android). The premium modules can be purchased and downloaded from the links provided above. 

### Firebase UI

##### Add the library

Add the following to your `build.gradle`

```
compile 'sdk.chat:chat-sdk-firebase-ui:4.8.9'
```

##### Enable the module

Add the following to the end of your `onCreate` method:

```
FirebaseUIModule.activate(context, GoogleAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID, PhoneAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID);
```

You can provide a list of providers as outlined in the [Firebase documentation](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android/blob/master/auth/README.md#sign-in-examples). 

>**Note**
>You will need to remove the `com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId` meta data from the app manifest or you will get a Gradle build error. 
  
### Other Modules

For the following modules:

- [Keyboard overlay](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/keyboard-overlay/)

After you have purchased the module you will be provided with a link to the module source code. Unzip this file and import it into Android Studio.

1. Click **File** -> **New** -> **Import Module**
2. Add the module to your `build.gradle`

  ```
  compile project(path: ':chat_sdk_[module name]')
  ```
  
3. Sync Gradle
4. In your main class `onCreate` activate the module:

  ```
  ContactBookModule.activate();
  ```
  
### Adding Modules Manually

In Android Studio:

**File** -> **New** -> **Import Module**

You must import the following core module:

- `chat-sdk-ui`

And at least **one** network adapter:

- `chat-sdk-firebase-adapter`
- `chat_sdk_xmpp_adapter` - [Available here](https://chatsdk.co/downloads/xmpp-chat-sdk-for-android/)

And any of the following optional modules:

- `chat-sdk-firebase-file-storage`
- `chat-sdk-firebase-push`
- `chat-sdk-audio-message` - [Available here](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/audio-messages/)
- `chat-sdk-video-message` - [Available here](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/android-video-messages/)
- `chat-sdk-sticker-message` - [Available here](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/sticker-messages/)
- `chat-sdk-read-receipts` - [Available here](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/read-receipts/)
- `chat-sdk-typing-indicator` - [Available here](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/typing-indicator/)
- `chat-sdk-contact-book` - [Available here](http://chatsdk.co/downloads/contact-book-integration/)

Now import the modules in your `build.gradle` file. 

```
compile project(path: ':chat-sdk-ui')
compile project(path: ':chat-sdk-firebase-push')
``` 

If you want to import modules manually, you should add the following to your `gradle.properties` file:

```
useLocal=true
```

You will also need to make sure that you've included the library versions in your main project level `build.gradle` file by adding the following:

```
ext {
    bintrayVersion = "1.8.4"
    mavenGradleVersion = "2.1"
    androidxAppcompatVersion = "1.0.2"
    androidxConstraintLayoutVersion = "2.0.0-alpha5"
    androidxLifecycleExtensionsVersion = "2.0.0"
    androidxRecyclerViewVersion = "1.0.0"
    androidxMultidexVersion = "2.0.1"
    materialVersion = "1.0.0"
    playAuthVersion = "16.0.1"
    playMapsVersion = "16.1.0"
    googlePlacesVersion = "1.1.0"
    playLocationVersion = "16.0.0"
    firebaseUiVersion = "4.3.2"
    firebaseCoreVersion = "16.0.9"
    firebaseDatabaseVersion = "17.0.0"
    firebaseAuthVersion = "17.0.0"
    firebaseStorageVersion = "17.0.0"
    firebaseMessagingVersion = "18.0.0"
    firebaseFunctionsVersion = "17.0.0"
    firebaseIIDVersion = "18.0.0"
    timberVersion = "4.7.1"
    greenDaoVersion = "3.2.2"
    frescoVersion = "1.13.0"
    rxJavaVersion = "2.2.8"
    rxAndroidVersion = "2.1.1"
    gsonVersion = "2.8.5"
    jodaTimeVersion = "2.10.1"
    jodaConvertVersion = "2.2.0"
    apacheCommonsVersion = "3.8.1"
    compressorVersion = "2.1.0"
    okHttpVersion = "3.11.0"
    facebookLoginVersion = "4.38.1"
    twitterVersion = "3.3.0"
    prettyTimeVersion = "4.0.1.Final"
    countryPickerVersion = "2.0.0"
    imageCropperVersion = "2.8.0"
    photoViewVersion = "2.3.0"
    materialDrawerVersion = "6.1.2"
    androidDatabaseSQLCipher = "4.1.3@aar"
    matisseVersion = "0.5.2-beta4"
    speedDial = "2.0.1"
}
```

This will prompt the modules to use local versions of the core Chat SDK modules rather than the versions hosted on Gradle. 

#### Configuring the project

Now that the modules have been added, we need to configure the project. 

**SDK Version**

Now you will see that gradle cannot be sync because it missing some parameters. Open to **gradle.properties** file in the root of the project and make sure the following lines are set to the [latest values](https://github.com/chat-sdk/chat-sdk-android/blob/master/gradle.properties).

```
MIN_SDK = 16
ANDROID_BUILD_TARGET_SDK_VERSION = 25
ANDROID_COMPILE_SDK_VERSION = 28
ANDROID_SUPPORT_VERSION = 28.0.0
```

> **Note:**
>You should make sure that the correct SDK versions and build tools are installed in Android Studio. To do this open the Preferences panel and navigate to **Appearance & Behavior** -> **System Settings** -> **Android SDK** or click on the **SDK Manager** icon in the tool bar. Android SDK versions 4.4 and onwards should be installed. **Android SDK Build-Tools** version 21.1.0 should be installed. 

Add any other modules that you need. Then sync the project with gradle. 

## Backend agnostic architecture

The user interface for the Chat SDK is completely decoupled from the backend. This means that the Chat SDK can be adapted to connect to any type of messaging server by creating a custom network adapter. Currently we have written two network adapters, one for Firebase and another for XMPP. This has a number of benefits:

1. You can connect the Chat SDK user interface to your messaging server by writing a custom network adapter. This saves you the complex job of building a full user interface. 

2. You can switch the backend your app uses. Imagine that you decide to start off with the Firebase version of the Chat SDK but at some point you decide that you want to switch to using an XMPP server. Usually, this would require a full rewrite of the messaging client but with the Chat SDK it can be achieved by changing one line of code! 

If you want more details about writing a custom network adapter you can email us at [team@sdk.chat](mailto:team@sdk.chat).
